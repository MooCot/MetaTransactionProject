We need to transfer USDT on ETH from multiple wallets to admin wallet without user paying gas fee.

It should be in one transaction to save the gas.

So let say there are 3 users each holding 100,200,300 usdt respectively.
They will just sign the transaction off-chain and pass it to admin.
Admin will then collect all three transactions and submit those to blockchain also paying the gas fee.
